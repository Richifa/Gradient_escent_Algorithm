What is gradient descent?
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm which is commonly-used to train machine learning models and neural networks.  
Training data helps these models learn over time, and the cost function within gradient descent specifically acts as a barometer, gauging its accuracy with each iteration of parameter updates. Until the function is close to or equal to zero, the model will continue to adjust its parameters to yield the smallest possible error. Once machine learning models are optimized for accuracy, 
they can be powerful tools for artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science applications.
